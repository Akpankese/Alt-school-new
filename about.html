    <p>I am a Project Manager/Service technician in an Engineering company in Lagos, Nigeria. Started as a service technician, then with time, i was given projects to handle with supervision, with less supervision and now, I plan and execute projects with little hiccups</p>

     <br>
     <p>I want to be a Software engineer, so that i can basically work and earn from home, while keeping my analytical skills always active. I have taken courses on product deign  and product management before and these have given me not only new skills but new perspective into the tech ecosystem. I am just starting my journey, and i do not have any other expectation than <strong>to win</strong></strongto></p>
